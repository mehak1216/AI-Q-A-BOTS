## Next steps I can do for you (pick any):
- Create a PDF of this report.
- Create a runnable ZIP with files saved to `/mnt/data` so you can download.
- Push to a GitHub repo (I can generate the instructions / git commands and a suitable `git init` + commit script).
- Swap the implementation to use Hugging Face inference instead of OpenAI.


Tell me which of the next steps you want and I will do it now.
