# Tiny AI Q&A Bot (CLI)

A tiny command-line app that asks an LLM a user question and prints the answer. Built for the intern assignment: "Build a Tiny AI-Powered App" (Option 1).

## What I built
- `main.py`: CLI question-answer loop using OpenAI's ChatCompletion API.
- Optional `streamlit_app.py` for a minimal web UI (stretch goal).
